        <p>We were sick and tired of spending hours reading books just to learn something that could have been summarized in a few paragraphs, so we decided to create minutereads.io to fix that.</p>
        
        <p>Minute Reads helps you <strong>learn more in less time</strong> by delivering quick, high-quality book summaries that save you hours. Our mission is to make knowledge more accessible by condensing the best ideas from books across business, self-improvement, and productivity into easy-to-digest reads.</p>
        
        <p>But we're just getting started.</p>
        
        <p>Our long-term goal is to become the go-to platform for summarizing <strong>all forms of content</strong>â€”not just books. This includes:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>University textbooks</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Research papers</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Podcasts</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Financial documents</strong></li>
        </ul>
